2. Key Insights:
------------------------------
a) XGBoost Model:
   - Highest overall accuracy (90.00%)
   - Most balanced performance across all classes
   - Strong precision and recall for all usage intensities
   - Particularly good at identifying high usage intensity (95% recall)

b) Random Forest Model:
   - Second-best overall accuracy (87.50%)
   - Excellent at identifying low usage intensity (93% precision)
   - Slightly weaker at medium usage intensity classification

c) Logistic Regression Model:
   - Lowest overall accuracy (79.50%)
   - Perfect precision for low usage intensity (100%)
   - Struggles with medium usage intensity (57% recall)
   - Good at identifying high usage intensity (100% recall)

3. Recommendations:
------------------------------
1. XGBoost is the recommended model for this task due to:
   - Highest overall accuracy
   - Most balanced performance across all classes
   - Strong predictive power for all usage intensities

2. If interpretability is important, Random Forest is a good alternative:
   - Only slightly lower accuracy than XGBoost
   - Provides feature importance insights
   - More stable predictions

3. Logistic Regression, while less accurate, provides:
   - Simple, interpretable model
   - Good at identifying extreme cases (very low or very high usage)
   - Useful for understanding linear relationships in the data
